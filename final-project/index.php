            <h2>Welcome, Hunter!</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the world of Shin Megami Tensei! Specifically, the world of Shin Megami Tensei IV, released in 2013 by Atlus.</p>
            <p>This game was a JRPG for the Nintendo 3DS, set in a post-apocalyptic Tokyo which has been invaded by demons, creatures from myth and legend from all around the world. The 
                surviving humans of Tokyo banded together and created the "Hunter Association", a group of demon hunters who help each other and the rest of the survivors.
            </p>
            <p>Hunters fight using guns, blades, and magic, as well as their own summoned demons! This site features a <a href='compendium.php'>compendium of these demons</a>, with a selection of those found in 
                the game. You can also make your very own request of the association using <a href='contact.php'>the contact form!</a>
            </p>
            <p>Good luck out there!</p>
