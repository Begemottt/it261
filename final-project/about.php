            <p>The Hunter Association was founded by survivors in the wake of the apocalyptic nuclear war, and subsequent enclosure of Tokyo in an enormous dome.</p>
            <p>Hunters are people who fight back agains the demons and angels that come to plague humanty in the aftermath of this great calamity. With their trusty 
                smartphones at their side, loaded with the miraculous Demon Summoning App, they are able to stand a chance against these mysterious entities that are 
                beyond human comprehension.</p>
            <p>This group organizes these brave warriors and directs their efforts to those in need, as well as coordinating specialized operations against the other factions 
                of Tokyo. We have offices in every ward, usually in the local bar. Feel free to stop by any time!</p>
            <h2>What Does the Hunter Association Do?</h2>
            <p>We take on any sort of dangerous job that may involve fighting demons or angels. Tokyo is a dangerous place these days, and if you're doing anything outside of a 
                settlement, you're probably going to need some protection.</p>
            <p>Bodyguarding is our most common job type, but we can also protect whole caravans, search for specfic resources, or anything else that needs doing out there in the 
                wild streets of Tokyo.</p>
            <h2>History of the Hunter Association</h2>
            <p>The HA was founded by Fujiwara about ten years ago, in the wake of the apocalypse. We have spread our roots and served the public interest ever since.</p>
